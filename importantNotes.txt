Whenever a state variable changes, react will re-render all the elements

how react works at behind the scenes:

https://github.com/acdlite/react-fiber-architecture

Monolith and Mirco service architecture

# ways of using api call

1. Page loads -> call api -> render the components using api data

2. page loads -> render the components -> api call -> re-render the components using api data

Important Note: The (2) second approach should be used as it is the best approach, because until the api call is completed user will see atleast some UI so that we can get better user expierence

# IMP's

1. CORS
2. How React works
3. Optional Chaining
4. Monolith and Micro serice architecture
5. Promises
6. Map, Filter, Reduce
7. Promises
8. Async Await

Whenever there is a change in state variable, react re-renders whole component

# useEffect

1. two arguments, first is arrow function, second is dependency array
2. if no dependency array, then useffect will be called on every render
3. if the useEffect has an empty dependency array then it will be called only on the first rendering of the component
4. If there is an dependency array, then useEffect will be called everytime the array will change
